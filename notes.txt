Replacement PCB for BC29 AH Meter

Low side shunt: 0.0006 Ohms = 0.6 mOhms => 10mA:6uV, 100A:60mV, 250A:150mV

Low side current monitor ADC with +-150mV range.
Dynamic range: 250/.01 = 1/25000 = 15 bits.

The integrator output, at pin 6, triggers one of
two comparators: IC2:A or IC2:C. IC2:C is triggered to give a low pulse when
the integrator reaches -1.25V, signifying a discharge of 1/900 Ah, or 4
Amp-seconds, or 4 coulombs. Conversely, IC2:A gives a low pulse when the
integrator reaches +1.25V, signifying +4 coulombs of charge. A "charge" pulse
sets flip-flop IC4:A (synchronized on the 1024Hz clock), causing the green LED
to blink on the display, and causing 1/9 of a 0.01Ah count up on the display.


That spacing seems reasonable. For potting I'm thinking of using "neutral-cure" RTV silicone.

As far as the ADC is concerned I have the following specs:

This part looks interesting:
